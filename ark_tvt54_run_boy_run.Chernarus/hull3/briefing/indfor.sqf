A super hacker created a device that allowed the operator of said device to infiltrate and control every satelitte above earth. When the hacker presented this device at DEFCON in Las Vegas it caught the attention of several state and non-state actors. From that point onwards it was a race against time as several factions started started operations to obtain said device. Eventually we tracked down, offed, and robbed the super hacker. We have captured the device. Unfortunately it seems to be the case that once it got separated from its owner a GPS tag started broadcasting its location to the world to see. So everyone knows where we are, and we need to outrun them.
