A super hacker created a device that allowed the operator of said device to infiltrate and control every satelitte above earth. When the hacker presented this device at DEFCON in Las Vegas it caught the attention of several state and non-state actors. From that point onwards it was a race against time as several factions started started operations to obtain said device. Eventually the super hacker got tracked down, murdered, and robbed. With the winner so far seeming to be NAPA. Unknown to everyone involved: as soon as the device got separated from its previous owner a GPS tag started broadcasting its location to the world to see.
