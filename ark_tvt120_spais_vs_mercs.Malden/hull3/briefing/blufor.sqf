<br/>
Due to a computer error in the Malden's Amazon Fulfilment Center a number of valuable assets purchased by the sitting party of Malden (Malden's Independent Liberal Future Party AKA M.I.L.F.) have been delivered to the wrong address, at the wrong time, resulting in a delicate situation that needs resolving ASAP. To protect the assets and to retain customer satisfaction Amazon hired a band of highly praised mercenaries. Targeting these assets is a small corporation specialised in covert operations hired by the Nogova Democratic Union (N.D.U) who rather sees these assets destroyed, to further their own goals and the hamper M.I.L.F.'s ability to operate.<br/>
