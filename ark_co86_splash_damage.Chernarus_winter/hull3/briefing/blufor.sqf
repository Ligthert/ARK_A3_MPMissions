Freshly shipped out of Germany we landed at the <marker name='urhere'>the Vybor Airfield</marker> it quickly became obvious the supply department miscalculated the season in South Zagoria. Asked by the sitting South Zagorian government, we are tasked with security the airfield and the surrounding area from rebel forces.
<br/><br/>
ENEMY FORCES
<br/>
ChDKZ aka Chernarussian Movement of the Red Star is a rebel faction with South Zagoria. What they lack in skill they make up in numbers and fanaticism. While their usage of WARSAW PACT weapons may seem outdated by current day standards, they will still hurt.
<br/><br/>
FRIENDLY FORCES
<br/>
N/A (Its just us).

<p>Primary objective is to secure <marker name='ao'>the area east</marker> of <marker name='urhere'>the Vybor Airfield</marker>.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Clean the following objectives in any order.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>The ChDKZ forces are dug in and established a FOB in <marker name='obj_fob'>the Devil's Castle</marker>. It houses a forces and supplies vital to their control of South Zagoria.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>The ChDKZ commander going by name Jan Havel (AKA the man with the golden gun) will most likely be held up in <marker name='obj_cnc'>a well defended position</marker> which functions as ChDKZ their command and control center. </p><br/>
<br/>
<p>Near the <marker name='obj_pobeda'>Pobeda Damn</marker> a small mortar site is located, covering most of the AO and will most likely pose a threat to us during our operation.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>In <marker name='obj_retal'>the fields of Novy Lug</marker> we have in the past sighted a heavy artillary base during our initial recon. These artillary piece have the abiliaty to engage anything in South Zagoria. It is imperative these pieces are being taken out.</p><br/>
<br/>
<p>It cannot be stressed enouch: ChDKZ is known to retaliate. Act accordingly in light of this truth.</p><br/>
