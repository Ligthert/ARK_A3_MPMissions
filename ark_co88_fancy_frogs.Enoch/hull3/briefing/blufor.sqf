<br/>
The Russians have been using the means of chemical warfare to inhibit the reproduction of certain animals in the local wildlife and have recently started exporting it via chemtrails over the border. Thanks to reliable sources on a Korean basket weaving forum we have managed to locate a series of labs to an unsuspicious set of buildings in the southern parts of Lovania. Its our task to disrupt these factories to prevent further spead of this endemic disease that is hurting our funny amphibian friends and in turn our children.<br/>
<br/>
In addition there is a wall of Anti-Air installations that need to be disabled so our helicarrier can pass through safely towards are next destination.<br/>
<br/><br/>
ENEMY FORCES
<br/>
- A battallion of infantry<br/>
- About 10 technicals<br/>
- Possibly heavy armor and rotating-wing aircraft<br/>
<br/><br/>
FRIENDLY FORCES
<br/>
N.A. -- Its just us and our simple heli-carrier.<br/>

// Mission

<br/>
<b>Primary Tasks:</b><br/>
- Destroy the equipment in these labs:<br/>
 - <marker name='factory1'>The Refinery</marker>, this factory refines raw materials into its purest form before being used for further processing. Destroy the tank in the building to disable the centrifuges and everything in the immediate area.<br/>
 - <marker name='factory2'>The Mixer</marker>, the exact position isn't known as it resides in a larger factory district in Livonia. In this factory the purified ingredients are mixed into a new solution. The key component is most likely the generater as it provides the power to the storage system of the volitile goods. Destroying this and fysics and chemistry will do the rest.<br/>
 - <marker name='factory3'>Factory #3</marker><br/>
 <br/>
 <b>Secundary tasks:</b><br/>
 - Disable Anti-air installations:<br/>
  - <marker name='AA1'>AA #1</marker>, Flak Tower 77<br/>

  - <marker name='AA3'>AA #3</marker>, Radar 56<br/>

Engagement-ranges of the AA-sites are marked on the map. Avoid flying with anything in their until the threats have ben neutrilized.<br/>
<br/>
Targets of Opportunity:<br/>
